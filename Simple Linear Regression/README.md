## Prediction Using Simple Linear Regression
* Handled Head Brain dataset by modelling Regression line to predict Brain weight with Head Size as independent variable.
* Created model from scratch using Python as well as using in built library function.
* Calculated MSE (Mean Square Error), RMSE (Root mean square error) & R2. 
* Envisioned other results through graphs of training and testing data and plot for MSE and RMSE.
